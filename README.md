# ChatMe messenger app on PHP
My third project focused on dynamic pages with PHP. Most of code was written using PHP and MySQL.
After signing-in or logging-in user can select any other user to chat with.

## Used languages
### Languages
* PHP
* MySQL
* CSS
* HTML

## Features
* User list - contains information about all users that visited website and their status (Online/OFfline).
* Real Time chat - send/recieve messages without delay.
* Session support - even after closing website, session is open, until user logout (no need to log-in again after returning to website)

## Future updates
In the future, I plan to add couple of updates to ChatMe:

* User status: after closing tab with website, status will be automatically changed to "Offline".
* Friend list: logged-in user will see friend list, instead of all users list.
* Add to friend button: users can add each other in "Friends", which means that they are able to chat.
* Group chats: users can create chats for more then 2 people.
### Bugs to fix
CSS: on some devices messages display incorrectly

## Current link
**Due to hosting platform issues, when website is opened in first time, it may took couple of seconds to load index page.**
