# ChatMe messenger app on PHP
My third project focused on dynamic pages with PHP. Most of code was written using PHP and MySQL.
After signing-in or logging-in user can select any other user to chat with.

## Used languages
### Languages
* PHP
* MySQL
* CSS
* HTML

## Features
* User list - contains information about all users who have visited the website and their status (Online/Offline).
* Real-time chat - send/recieve messages without delay.
* Session support - even after closing the website, the session will be open until the user logs out (no need to log-in again after returning to website)

## Future updates
In the future, I plan to add couple of updates to ChatMe:

* User status: after closing tab with website, status will automatically be changed to "Offline".
* Friend list: logged-in users will see their friend list instead of a list of all users.
* Add to friend button: users can add each other as friends, which means that they are able to chat.
* Group chats: users can create chats for more then two people.
### Bugs to fix
CSS: on some devices messages display incorrectly
